Warning
=======

This project is based on a way outdated version of MoonXML and only meant as a proof of concept.

With newer versions of MoonXML it should be possible to implement dom-node generation on top of the core, not as a fork, using the node handlers.

FengariXML
==========

This project is a fork from [MoonXML](//github.com/darkwiiplayer/moonxml) that, instead of generating XML or HTML code, uses Fengaris API to directly create DOM-Nodes that can be inserted into the document.
